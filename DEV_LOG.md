# Dev Log

## Day 1 - Firebase Stabilization + Employer Jobs Fix
- Goal: Single Firebase init + employer dashboard shows employer-posted jobs.
- Locked decision: All imports from "@/lib/firebase" only.
- Files changed:
  - src/lib/firebase.ts
  - src/app/employer/post-job/page.tsx
  - src/app/employer/dashboard/page.tsx
- Replaced imports:
  - "@/lib/firebase" -> "@/lib/firebase"
  - "@/lib/firebase" -> "@/lib/firebase"
- Result:
  - Employer can post job and see it in employer dashboard.
## Checkpoint: Firebase + Dashboard/Roles (WIP)

### Goal
Unify Firebase imports and stop role/dashboard confusion.

### Current Firebase source of truth
- src/lib/firebase.ts exports: auth, db, storage, app

### Known broken/cleanup items to finish next
- Remove old imports like "@/lib/firebase/auth" and "@/lib/firebase/db"
- Fix any remaining imports pointing to "@/lib/firebase/applicationService.ts" using "./db" etc
- Make /dashboard role-aware redirect:
  - candidate -> /candidate/home
  - employer -> /employer/dashboard
- Sidebar should be role-aware (no mixed menus)

### Next session plan
1) Fix remaining build errors (import paths)
2) Implement /dashboard redirect by role
3) Separate Candidate Home and Employer Dashboard UX

Employer Dashboard UI Stabilization (Current Sprint)

Changes Implemented

Resolved duplicate navigation issue

Identified that both Top Navbar and Left Sidebar were rendering employer navigation.

Removed sidebar navigation rendering for /employer/dashboard.

Final rule: Top Navbar is the single source of navigation for employer flows.

Stabilized Employer Dashboard layout

Dashboard now renders:

Left column → Filters only (Job status + Search)

Right column → Jobs & Responses content

Removed layout conflicts caused by nested flex containers.

Adopted a grid-based layout inside the dashboard page only.

Fixed disappearing UI issue

Root cause: early return based on getAuth().currentUser.

Removed auth-based early return.

Dashboard layout always renders.

Auth now gates data, not structure.

Unified filter logic

Filters exist only in employer/dashboard/page.tsx.

Removed filter/search UI from global sidebar.

Ensured job status values match backend schema:

open, closed, draft

UI label “Active jobs” correctly maps to open.
## 2025-12-15 21:40 (IST) — Employer Dashboard: mobile filters + clear + status counts

### Change
Upgraded Filters UX on `/employer/dashboard`:
- Mobile filters are collapsible using `Sheet` (drawer).
- Added `Clear filters` to reset search + status.
- Added per-status counts (Open / Closed / Draft) using `Badge`, computed from loaded jobs.

### Files changed
- src/app/employer/dashboard/page.tsx

### Notes
- No Firestore changes.
- Status keys remain backend-aligned: "open" | "closed" | "draft".
## 2025-12-15 00:54 (IST) — Employer Dashboard: persist filters in URL

### Change
Persisted dashboard filters in the URL to keep state across refresh/share:
- `status` stored as `?status=open|closed|draft` (omitted when "all")
- `search` stored as `?q=...` (omitted when empty)

### Files changed
- src/app/employer/dashboard/page.tsx

### Notes
- Uses `router.replace()` to avoid polluting browser history.
- Status values remain backend-aligned: "open" | "closed" | "draft".
## 2025-12-15 HH:MM (IST) — Employer Dashboard: normalize job status for filters + counts

### Issue
Existing job docs used legacy status values like "active" and "approved", while dashboard filters/counts expected canonical statuses: "open" | "closed" | "draft". This caused status filters to show no results and counts to remain 0.

### Fix
Added a status normalization layer in the employer dashboard UI:
- active/approved/published → open
- inactive → closed
- open/closed/draft → unchanged
Unknown values default to open to avoid hiding jobs.

### Files changed
- src/app/employer/dashboard/page.tsx

### Notes
UI-only stabilization. Firestore write logic will be updated separately to always write canonical statuses.
## 2025-12-15 22:10 (IST) — Fix build error in updateJobStatus import

### Issue
Build failed because `updateJobStatus.ts` attempted to import Firestore instance from a non-existent path (`@/lib/firebase/db`).

### Fix
Aligned Firestore import with existing project convention:
- Updated import to use `@/lib/firebase`.

### Files changed
- src/lib/updateJobStatus.ts

### Notes
No logic changes. Import path correction only.
## 2025-12-15 22:25 (IST) — Employer jobs: add Edit Job page + dashboard link

### Change
Enabled employers to edit an existing job:
- Added `/employer/jobs/[id]/edit` page to load job by id, prefill form fields, and update job document.
- Added "Edit" action button on employer dashboard job cards.

### Files changed
- src/app/employer/jobs/[id]/edit/page.tsx (new)
- src/app/employer/dashboard/page.tsx (add Edit button)

### Notes
- Edit updates `updatedAt` only.
- Does not modify ownership fields (`createdByUid`, `postedByUid`).
## 2025-12-15 22:45 (IST) — Employer Dashboard: backend response count wiring

### Change
Wired real application counts to Employer Dashboard job cards:
- Applications are fetched from `applications` collection.
- Counts are grouped by `jobId` and displayed per job.

### Files changed
- src/app/employer/dashboard/page.tsx

### Notes
- MVP implementation uses `where("jobId", "in", [...])` (max 10 jobs).
- No Firestore schema changes.
## 2025-12-15 23:05 (IST) — Firestore Security Rules: Jobs + Applications (MVP lockdown)

### Change
Implemented MVP Firestore security rules to protect production data:
- Jobs: public read only for published open jobs; owners can read/write their own jobs.
- Jobs updates: ownership fields locked; updates restricted to a safe whitelist; updatedAt must match request.time.
- Applications: candidates can create for published/open jobs; candidates can read their own; employers can read apps for jobs they own.
- Counters locked (admin-only later).

### Files changed
- firestore.rules (or firebase/firestore.rules)

### Notes
Rules enforce canonical job statuses: "open" | "closed" | "draft".
## 2025-12-16 00:10 (IST) — Git reset to last stable employer MVP

### Context
Local changes caused application breakage during ongoing development.

### Action
Reset working directory to last known stable commit:
- Employer dashboard MVP (filters, job actions, edit job, response counts, Firestore rules)

### Commit restored
- 029e89b

### Notes
All subsequent development will follow small-change + immediate-commit workflow.
## 2025-12-16 00:40 (IST) — Setup: Firestore Rules testing via Firebase Emulator

### Change
Started validating Firestore security rules using Firebase Emulator Suite to avoid breaking production rules during iteration.

### Notes
- Firestore Emulator runs locally (default 8080) with Emulator UI (default 4000).
- App can be configured to connect to emulator in development mode.
## 2025-12-16 02:05 (IST) — Fixed employer job posting (canonical write)

### Change
Fixed Post Job submit handler to write only canonical fields.

### Details
- Removed legacy `employerId`
- Replaced status `"active"` with `"open"`
- Always write:
  - createdByUid
  - postedByUid
  - isPublished = true

### Impact
- New jobs reliably appear on employer dashboard
- Filters and counts work correctly
## 2025-12-16 03:30 (IST) — Jobs migration dry-run validated (no changes needed)

### Action
Ran Admin SDK dry-run migration script against `jobs` collection.

### Result
- Scanned: 11 jobs
- Already compliant: 11
- Would change: 0
- Failures: 0
- CAN_PROCEED = true

### Conclusion
No legacy normalization required for current jobs dataset. Remaining issues are likely Auth/Rules/config, not job document schema.
## 2025-12-16 04:25 (IST) — Fix job posting permission-denied (Firestore rules)

### Problem
Employer Post Job failed with: `permission-denied: Missing or insufficient permissions`.

### Root cause
Firestore rules incorrectly required `createdAt/updatedAt == request.time`, which fails when the client writes `serverTimestamp()`.

### Fix
Relaxed timestamp equality checks and validated create/update using:
- ownership (createdByUid/postedByUid == auth.uid)
- allowed fields only
- allowed status enum (open/closed/draft)
## 2025-12-16 04:50 (IST) — Unblocked Post Job by allowing counters access (MVP)

### Problem
Post Job failed with `permission-denied` even after fixing jobs rules.

### Root cause
`generateJobDhariId()` writes to `/counters/*`, but rules denied all counters reads/writes.

### Fix
Temporarily allowed authenticated read/write on `/counters/{docId}` to unblock job posting.

### Note
This is an MVP-only relaxation; tighten before beta (prefer Cloud Function ID generation).
## 2025-12-16 04:58 (IST) — Employer Job Posting Fully Unblocked

### Outcome
Employer can now successfully post jobs.

### Root cause (final)
`generateJobDhariId()` writes to `/counters/*`, but Firestore rules denied all access to counters, causing silent `permission-denied` during job creation.

### Fix
Temporarily allowed authenticated read/write access to `/counters/{docId}` for MVP.

### Status
System stable. Job create → dashboard → filters all working.
## 2025-12-16 05:05 (IST) — Employer MVP Stabilized & Committed

- Employer login, dashboard, job posting fully functional
- Firestore rules corrected for serverTimestamp + counters
- Legacy jobs migrated successfully
- System committed and tagged as `employer-mvp-stable`
## 2025-12-16 05:20 (IST) — Added EmployerGate auth guard for employer pages

### Change
Created a small client-side auth gate that:
- waits for Firebase auth state
- redirects unauthenticated users to /employer/login

### Files
- src/components/auth/EmployerGate.tsx
- src/app/employer/dashboard/page.tsx (wrapped with EmployerGate)
- src/app/employer/post-job/page.tsx (wrapped with EmployerGate)
## 2025-12-16 05:30 (IST) — Fixed responses count for >10 jobs (Firestore in-query batching)

### Problem
Responses count query used `where("jobId", "in", jobIds.slice(0,10))`, so it ignored jobs beyond 10.

### Fix
Added helper to batch `jobId in [...]` queries in chunks of 10 and aggregate counts across all jobs.

### Files
- src/lib/firebase/getApplicationCountsByJobIds.ts (new)
- src/app/employer/dashboard/page.tsx (use helper)
## 2025-12-16 05:40 (IST) — Employer auth guard + response count batching committed

### Added
- EmployerGate to redirect unauthenticated users away from employer pages
- Responses count query batching to remove Firestore `in` query 10-item limit

### Git
- Committed and pushed stable checkpoint
- Tag: employer-dashboard-stable-2
## 2025-12-16 05:55 (IST) — Added Repost/Bump + safer employer job actions

### Added
- Repost button: sets job to open + published and bumps updatedAt (moves job to top)

### Improved
- Added per-job action loading state so buttons disable while an action is running
- Centralized job actions via a single helper to avoid duplicate async logic

### Files
- src/lib/updateJobFields.ts (new)
- src/app/employer/dashboard/page.tsx (repost + UX polish)
## 2025-12-16 06:30 (IST) — Employer UX: toast feedback for job actions

### Added
- Toast notifications for employer job actions (loading/success/error)

### Files
- src/app/layout.tsx (Toaster added)
- src/app/employer/dashboard/page.tsx (runJobAction now toasts)
### Dependencies
- sonner
## 2025-12-16 07:05 (IST) — Added public job detail page

- Added getPublicJobById() helper for public-safe job fetching
- Added /jobs/[id] page with apply CTA (apply flow next)
## 2025-12-16 07:35 (IST) — Added Apply gate foundation
- Added /apply/[id] route
- Enforced login requirement before apply
- Validated job availability before application
- Redirect-based flow for future profile/apply steps
## 2025-12-16 07:55 (IST) — Fixed public job visibility + dashboard refresh jobs bug

### Public jobs visibility
- Root cause: new jobs were created as draft/unpublished, so /jobs page did not show them.
- Fix: createEmployerJob now defaults to status="open" and isPublished=true for MVP.

### Employer dashboard refresh
- Root cause: relying on getAuth().currentUser caused employerId to be undefined on initial refresh.
- Fix: dashboard now derives employerId via onAuthStateChanged() for stable loading.
## 2025-12-16 08:05 (IST) — MVP decision: job posts are published immediately
- Default job creation now uses status="open" and isPublished=true
- Drafts remain available only via explicit employer action
## 2025-12-16 08:15 (IST) — Candidate discovery foundation shipped

- Added /jobs public listing (open + published jobs)
- Added /jobs/[id] public job detail page
- Added /apply/[id] apply gate (login → profile redirect stub)
- Fixed dynamic routing issue by using [id] folder naming
- Committed milestone tag: candidate-discovery-v1
## 2025-12-16 08:55 (IST) — Apply flow end-to-end (profile gate + application create)

- /apply/[id] now checks candidateProfile existence
- Added applicationsService with duplicate prevention
- Apply creates applications doc with serverTimestamp appliedAt
- Updated Firestore rules to allow serverTimestamp for appliedAt (removed request.time equality)
## 2025-12-17 03:20 (IST) — Jobs page reads hero search params

- Updated /jobs to support URL params: q, loc, exp
- Added location filter (in-memory) and experience param (reserved)
- Search button rebuilds URL params consistently (no Firestore query changes)
## 2025-12-17 03:45 (IST) — Fix Apply build + clarify profile persistence

- Added src/lib/firebase/applicationsService.ts (applyToJob) to resolve missing module import
- Confirmed candidate profile form likely rehydrates saved profile (edit-mode), not a “clear after save” wizard
- Verified saved profile location should be checked via candidateProfileService.ts Firestore path
## 2025-12-17  — Apply flow + responses wiring hardening (IST)

- Fixed inconsistent import naming between `applicationsService` vs `applicationService`.
- Apply UX: prevent re-applying loops by disabling Apply when already applied and redirecting `/apply/[id]` back to job page when application exists.
- Employer dashboard: hardened response count fetching by batching `where("jobId", "in", ...)` queries in chunks of 10.
- Standardized application write contract to use `applications.jobId` = Firestore jobs doc id.
## 2025-12-17 05:10 (IST) — Apply button state + employer responses list

- Replaced raw Apply links with <ApplyJobButton /> so UI shows “Applied” after applying
- Added employer responses page: /employer/jobs/[id]/responses
- Added “View responses” button in employer dashboard to view applicants per job
## 2025-12-17 05:35 (IST) — Candidate apply UX follow-up (in progress)

- Noted UX gap: Apply toast succeeds but Apply button does not change to “Applied”
- Plan: verify Apply button uses ApplyJobButton; ensure jobId matches Firestore doc id; add re-check on focus if needed
- Added FAILURE_LOG.md to track future incidents and avoid repeating past debugging paths
## 2025-12-17 06:10 (IST) — Apply UX structural fix (auto-apply gate)

- Reworked /apply/[id] to auto-apply when user is logged in + has candidate profile
- Removed “Ready to apply” double-confirmation UX; now Apply is one-click
- Apply gate redirects back to /jobs/[id] with success toast
## 2025-12-17 06:50 (IST) — Feature Map generation system added

- Added `scripts/generate-feature-map.mjs` to scan `src/` and generate `docs/FEATURE_MAP.md`
- Added npm script: `docs:featuremap`
- Introduced lightweight `@feature` annotations in key pages/services to map features → files
- Standardization rule: use consistent feature names across files to avoid duplicate buckets
## 2025-12-18 20:25 (IST) — Feature map upgraded (routes + Firestore collection map)

- Updated `scripts/generate-feature-map.mjs` to auto-detect Next.js routes from `src/app/**/page.tsx`
- Added auto-detection of Firestore collection usage via `collection(db, "<name>")`
- `docs/FEATURE_MAP.md` now includes: annotated feature buckets + routes map + Firestore collections map + file inventory
## 2025-12-18 21:25 (IST) — ApplyGate navigation carries applied flag

- Updated `src/app/apply/[id]/page.tsx` “Back to job” to redirect to `/jobs/[id]?applied=1` for consistent post-apply UX
- ApplyGate remains read-only confirmation (no write)
## DEV-014 — Fix employer dashboard layout rendering

**Date:** 2025-12-19  

### Change
- Removed layout primitives from employer dashboard page
- Ensured single layout owner via `EmployerLayout`

### Reason
Resolved **F-001 (Employer dashboard rendered blank due to layout conflict)**

### Outcome
Dashboard content now renders consistently on load and refresh.
